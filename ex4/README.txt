Overview
This project explores sentiment analysis using multiple machine learning models applied to a dataset of labeled sentences. 
The implemented models range from simple architectures like log-linear models to advanced Transformer-based models. 
The focus is on evaluating model performance not only on standard validation and test datasets but also on two specialized subsets: 
Negated Polarity (sentences with negations) and Rare Words (sentences with infrequent words).
