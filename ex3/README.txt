Overview
This project implements and evaluates several methods for Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). 
The notebook leverages the Brown Corpus and employs techniques like maximum likelihood estimation, 
Add-One smoothing, and pseudo-words for improved handling of unknown and low-frequency words.
